# Report for Banking System Database Project
## Introduction

This project was developed to demonstrate how a banking system stores, manages, and analyzes customer, account, and transaction information using a relational database.
The system provides a structured way to understand how customers interact with their bank accounts and how financial activities can be monitored.

## Purpose of the Project

The goal of the project is to:

📍 Organize customer data in a clean and secure format

📍 Track different types of accounts such as savings, current, and fixed deposit

📍 Record all financial activities such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers

📍 Analyze transaction patterns to support decision-making

This project simulates a real-world banking database and shows how banks use data to improve operations.

## Overview of the System

The system is made up of three major components:

### A. Customer Information

This stores personal details such as name, gender, phone number, email, address, and date of birth.
It helps the bank identify each customer and track their interactions.

### B. Accounts

Each customer can own one or more accounts.
The account table stores account number, type of account, balance, date opened, and account status.

### C. Transactions

This is where all financial activities are recorded.
Every deposit, withdrawal, and transfer is tracked with date, amount, and description.

## What the Analysis Shows

The analysis done using SQL queries helps the bank understand the following:

### A. Customer Insights

- How many customers the bank has

- Gender distribution

- Age groups

- Cities where most customers live

This information helps the bank plan marketing campaigns and improve service delivery.

### B. Account Insights

- Number of savings, current, and fixed deposit accounts

- Total amount of money stored in the bank

- Average balance per account type

- Number of active vs dormant accounts

- This helps the bank evaluate its financial strength.

### C. Transaction Insights

- Total number of transactions

- Deposit, withdrawal, and transfer patterns

- Daily and monthly transaction trends

- Accounts with the most activity

These insights help the bank monitor performance and customer behavior.

## Benefits of the System

- Helps the bank keep accurate financial records

- Detects unusual activities such as extremely large transactions

- Supports planning and decision-making

- Makes it easy to retrieve customer and account history

- Improves transparency and accountability

  ## Conclusion

This banking system database project successfully shows how a bank collects and analyzes data to support its operations.
With the queries developed, decision-makers can easily monitor transactions, understand customer demographics, and maintain secure financial operations.
